	* 1500 ml of the collected sample was inserted into the eppendorf tubes
	* The eppendorf tubes were then placed in the centrifuge machine for centrifugation at 
	   4500 rpm for 5 minutes
	* The supernatent was discarded after obtaining the pellet from the first centrifugation
	* 1500 ml of the sample was taken again
	* This process was repeated for 4 to 5 times to achieve a decent pellet

![Alt text](Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of extracted DNA.jpeg?raw=true "Title")

	* The pellets extracted were placed in agarose gel of 0.8% to ensure the presence of DNA
	* 2 μL of the loading dye and 6 μL of the DNA sample and a total of 8 μL of the agarose gel was prepared
	* The sample was visualized under UV light, after conducting the gel electrophoresis for up to 30 minutes
	* 2 μL ladder of 100kb was used

	* Annealing temperature was 60ºC
	* This annealing temperature was continued for 30 seconds
	* Agarose gel concentration was 2%
	* DNA bands were wild type homozygous

	* Tetra primers for ARMS PCR technique were designed using "BatchPrimer3 v1.0 A high throughput web application for PCR and sequencing primer design 1
	* Fixed parameters were used to design the primers

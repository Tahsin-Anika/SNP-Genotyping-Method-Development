	* 1500 ml of the collected sample was inserted into the eppendorf tubes
	* The eppendorf tubes were then placed in the centrifuge machine for centrifugation at 
	   4500 rpm for 5 minutes
	* The supernatent was discarded after obtaining the pellet from the first centrifugation
	* 1500 ml of the sample was taken again
	* This process was repeated for 4 to 5 times to achieve a decent pellet
